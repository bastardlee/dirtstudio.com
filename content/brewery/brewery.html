<h1>THE BREWERY</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Milwaukee, Wisconsin<br>2007</h2>
<p>
The historic Pabst Brewery redevelopment provides the opportunity to create a place that captures all of the spirit brewed on site since 1844. The challenge was to tap that spirit and let it inform the future without allowing the ‘improvements’ to diminish its industrial strength beauty. To structure the new development over time, the landscape armature can be built first, with events celebrating the industrial heritage in a contemporary city. The first step toward invigorating the neighborhood is a pocket park dedicated to an icon of the Milwaukee Community, Joseph Zilber.
