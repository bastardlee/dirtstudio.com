<h1>TURTLE CREEK WATER WORKS</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Dallas, Texas<br>2002</h2>
<p>
Turtle Creek carves a deep ravine through a Dallas neighborhood where the mosquitoes are as big as horses, and the houses are larger than life. Amidst the elaborate manicured landscapes sat an abandoned historic pumphouse with large reservoirs that once supplied the neighborhood’s water. These hot asphalt expanses and concrete volumes were transformed with a new flow of arts events and everyday play.
