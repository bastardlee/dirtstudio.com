<h1>NORTH SHORE REVITALIZATION</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Staten Island, New York<br>2009</h2>
<p>
From the landing of the Staten Island Ferry extending west to Mariners Marsh, the five mile stretch of Staten Island’s North Shore is an urban mosaic of historic remains of the ship-building era, active port facilities and ad hoc industries.  The challenge presented the necessity for balancing further private development of the port with much-needed public space for the inland park-poor neighborhoods.  The opportunity to celebrate the shipping heritage of the North Shore served as the underpinning of a multifaceted cultural landscape of commerce, industry, ecology and community.
</p>
<p>
The proposed landscape armature features civic promenades above and along the waterfront, neighborhood ‘landings’ as parks on the Kill van Kull, a rejuvenated Snug Harbor Heritage Center reclaiming its shore and coves with sunken boat carcasses supporting restored salt marshes.  Denying the assumption that the port industries and community resources are mutually exclusive, the hybrid landscape of the North Shore becomes a model for urban industrial ecology.
