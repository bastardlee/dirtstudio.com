<h1>HIGHLINE</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">New York, New York<br>2005</h2>
<p>
The perseverance of savvy ‘Friends’ saved the Highline from the hungry clutches of developers. Now dedicated as public space, the mile-plus long elevated rail line will allow locals and tourists to levitate through the west side of Manhattan. Our multi-disciplinary design team committed itself to embracing the wild landscape in all its untamed beauty. Proposing a process more than a product, the vision avoids the sexy spectacle of urban program, instead necessitating an understanding of nuanced landscape succession. This urban wilderness would contribute to and contrast the cultivated parks along the Hudson River.</p>
