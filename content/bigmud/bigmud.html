<h1>BIG MUD</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">New Orleans, Louisiana<br>2007 - 2009</h2>
<p>
Operation Paydirt, conceived of by conceptual artist Mel Chin, is an interdisciplinary initiative aimed at eliminating lead poisoning in children caused by decades of urban soil contamination across the country. Beginning with New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the initiative seeks to rebuild the city from below the ground up, employing a healthy foundation for the citizens to return to.  Big Mud, the difficult and dirty action plan, combines science and design in a strategy to recover the city of New Orleans for renewed landscapes and healthy communities. Lessons and methods developed in New Orleans can be exported back up the Mississippi to other cities where children continue to be poisoned by lead from the soil.
