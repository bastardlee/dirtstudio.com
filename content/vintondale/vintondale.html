<h1>VINTONDALE RECLAMATION PARK</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Vintondale, Pennsylvania<br>1995 – 1998, construction completed 2004</h2>
<p>
The Vintondale Reclamation Park project joined an interdisciplinary team of artists, designers, scientists and historians with local communities, watershed groups, and state and federal agencies, to collaborate on a model redevelopment initiative for coal regions. Brilliant orange streams and absence of life within their banks attest to the widespread environmental problem: devastation wrought by acid mine drainage (AMD). At the town of Vintondale, the first pilot project for the AMD+ART initiative took shape on forty acres of an abandoned colliery. With a focus on making remediation processes visible, the Vintondale project integrated passive treatment for acid mine drainage with a new recreational park for the adjacent post-mining town and connected it along a regional bike trail.

<p>
The floodplain was an expanse of black bony (mine refuse) and the Blacklick Creek was bright orange with deposited metals from AMD at 2.9 pH. The passive treatment system took didactic form with geometric basins that progressively transform the toxic orange cocktail into clean water. The "final rinse" of this giant ecological washing machine returns biologically rich water back into the creek, and into the larger watershed of coal country. Citizens of Vintondale and students of the Americorps program collaborated with D.I.R.T. in the design and planting process.
