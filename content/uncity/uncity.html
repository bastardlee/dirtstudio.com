<h2 class="place-date">New York, New York<br>2001</h2>
<p>
The isolated nine-acre Consolidated Edison power plant is transformed into a thriving new community at the edge of the East River as a model for a new kind of work/live urbanity. A thick urban wedge of public and commercial life, above and below the street, supports strategic towers slipped into the Manhattan skyline, enriching the river edge site into a diverse urban ecotone.
