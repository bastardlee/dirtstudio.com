<h1>URBAN OUTFITTERS HEADQUARTERS</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br>2005 – 2011</h2>
<p>
For over one hundred and fifty years, League Island developed as one the nation’s first Navy Yards where hundreds of men and women toiled to build entire fleets of huge ships. Remaining true to the industrious scale of adjacent active ship building operations and to the patina of past production, the Historic Core of the Yard has been refashioned for the retail enterprise, Urban Outfitters (URBN).
</p>
<p>
The massive industrial buildings retrofitted for design studios and corporate offices structure URBN’s new campus, and community, of creativity. Unearthing layers of industrial history, overlaying rebranded demolition materials with tapestries of hedgerows and drifts of wild + wooly grasses and wildflowers, emulates URBN’s sensibility for the next evolution of a productive landscape.
