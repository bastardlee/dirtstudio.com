<h2 class="place-date">North Adams, Massachusetts<br>1997</h2>
<p>
Thirteen acres of giant factory buildings are bisected by the concrete channels of the Hoosiac River.  The abandoned textile factory that once employed half the town now houses a contemporary art collection formerly hidden in storage. Vast industrial galleries are interwoven with commercial businesses and community services, revitalizing the town and integrating a network of art institutions within the region.
