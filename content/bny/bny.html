<h1>BROOKLYN NAVY YARD VISITORS CENTER</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">Brooklyn, New York<br>2009 – 2011</h2>
<p>
For nearly 150 years the Brooklyn Navy Yard produced over 85 vessels from schooners to battleships. Structures, like the many cranes that dramatically punctuate the site, evoke the Yard’s once active industrial character, especially the remarkable steel structures that once framed the construction of monumental steel-clad ships.
</p>
<p>
Alongside ship building, many ancillary buildings were constructed including Building 92, the US Marine Corps Commandant’s Residence, built in 1857. Run down and marked by the passage of time, the officers’ quarters is adaptively restored to its former glory as the Brooklyn Navy Yard Visitor’s Center, a LEED Platinum building that will house local non-profits as well as an exhibition space. The court serves as an entrance to the larger industrial park giving the gated and once cloistered Navy Yard a public face as it reaches out into the surrounding community.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by the underlying structure of a ship’s hull, the main court at the Visitor’s Center is structured by ‘ribs’ made with steel salvaged from the site.
</p>
<p>
The ‘boneyard’ is punctuated by remnant objects rescued from demolished buildings, set within a garden of busted concrete, amongst wild and wooly plants.
