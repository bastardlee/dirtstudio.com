<h1>HARDBERGER PARK AT VOELCKER FARM</h1>
<h2 class="place-date">San Antonio, Texas<br>2007 - 2009</h2>
<p>
The Master Plan for Voelcker Park asserts the power of a green microcosm of the regional landscape, inviting citizens across San Antonio to the new 311-acre city park. The design concept for a 'cultivated wild' preserves the Heritage Oaks and woodlands while restoring a native Texas emblem of vast grasslands. The renewed oak savanna sweeps over Wurzbach Parkway via a proposed land bridge connecting revitalized wildlife habitat to the Salado Creek Greenway. Seventy-five percent of the park will be devoted to the preservation and restoration of the native landscape.
</p>
<p>
The other twenty-five percent of Voelcker Park will be comprised of carefully crafted landscape spaces inspired by San Antonio's cultural history, most notably marked by the missions' patterns of harvesting water through acequias. The design vision for Voelcker Park seeks to inspire a land ethic that will foster city-wide stewardship of a healthy, 21st century San Antonio.
