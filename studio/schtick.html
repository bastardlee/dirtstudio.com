<h5>Dump It Right There</h5>

<p>
We are surrounded with detritus left by two centuries of industry. Mines and factories relentlessly churn out raw materials and products making our country rich and powerful. It’s taken an environmental crisis for us to finally face all the nasty by-products -- dumped in the river, or in a landfill, or just out back.

D.I.R.T. studio (Dump It Right There) was founded in 1992 by Julie Bargmann as a critical, design research-based practice driven by a love for the landscape, a concern for marginalized communities, research into eco-technologies, investigation of site histories, and an obsession with urban regeneration. We feel obligated, better yet, inspired to remake fallow Brownfields and derelict terrain into renewed landscapes of ecological and cultural production.

D.I.R.T. studio’s small but mighty design studio joins architects, planners, engineers, scientists, artists and historians to interface constructively with city, state and federal agencies to give simple form to spaces with many rich layers. Clients are not just customers; they are collaborators. Our investigative approach as designers informs our role as educators, creating a reciprocal feedback loop of adventurous investigation and evolving knowledge between practice and teaching.

D.I.R.T. studio strives to be catalytic and proactive, reframing crises as opportunities, detritus as resources. We dig into the deep strata of urban and post-industrial landscape systems – natural and social histories, production and engineering, technologies and sciences, policy and economics. We find ways to inventively multi-task the social and ecological performance of designs to maximize their impact. We unearth site histories and reuse existing materials with an artistic vengeance. We insist on deploying regenerative systems to rebuild natural resources, not simply exploit them. We make places and processes for communities to participate in rebuilding the vitality of their neighborhoods and cities. We give voice to the landscape. We aspire to the extra-ordinary to create grounded authentic places.</p>
